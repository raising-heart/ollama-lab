# AI Butler System (Ollama Version)

An intelligent AI Butler system powered by local LLM through Ollama, designed to provide professional and structured assistance across various tasks and inquiries.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. Ollama installed and running locally
3. llama3.2 model downloaded in Ollama

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Make sure Ollama is running and the llama3.2 model is available
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Start interacting with your AI Butler! Type 'exit' to end the conversation

## Features

- Professional and structured responses using clear icons:
  - üéØ Analysis: Assessment of the situation or query
  - üîß Process: Approach or steps to address the request
  - üó£Ô∏è Response: Formal response to the user
- Advanced conversation memory (last 50 messages)
- Emotional tone analysis of user input
- Session logging with timestamped files
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed API calls

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main application entry point
- `agents.py`: Implementation of AI agents (ToneAnalyzer and AIButler)
- `tasks.py`: Core task management and processing
- `traits.py`: AI Butler's personality and responsibility definitions
- `config.py`: Configuration settings

## Session Management

The system automatically creates session files for each conversation, stored in the `sessions/` directory. These files contain the complete interaction history with timestamps.

## Note

This implementation uses local LLM models through Ollama, providing a private and cost-effective solution while maintaining professional assistance capabilities. While the majority of responses follow the structured format with proper Butler persona, occasional inconsistencies may occur where the model deviates from the expected format or tone. This is a known limitation of using local LLMs, and continuous improvements are being made to enhance response consistency.
